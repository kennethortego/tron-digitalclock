# tron-digitalclock

Hey guys, if you have found this repo I'm still working on some details.

This screen saver was inspired from Tron Legacy, where Sam first sees the terminal digital clock counting time.  It is not a font currently, I am actually drawing each square to the screen.

Feel free to clone, build and deploy. Enjoy!
