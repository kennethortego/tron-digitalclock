# tron-digitalclock

Hey guys, if you have found this repo I'm still working on some details.

This screen saver was inspired from Tron Legacy, where Sam first sees the terminal digital clock counting time.  It is not a font currently, I am actually drawing each square to the screen. Available in macOS and Windows.

>I wasn't able to find this anywhere out on the web, so I took screen shots of the movie and replicated as close as I could to the real thing, right now it only goes out to days, not sure if anyone would let there machine sit there for a month or more (years? really).

Feel free to clone, build and deploy. Enjoy!
